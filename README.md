==================

A simple, lightweight, no db cms with a templating system.

## To Do

* Add template_part() function
* Add draft ability. Files with draft_ prepended are ignored and not accessible.
* Fully functional info handler
* Page Content Object (with variable parsing?)
* Image Handling
* Agnostic Loop function (diet WP loop)
* Proper 404 handling (pass back to index.php via .htaccess)
