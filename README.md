charlie (v1.0.0-beta)
==================

A lightweight cms, built for creatives.

Run your own site with less overhead and more control.

No installation files, no database.

## Beta Notice (v1.0.0-beta)

Charlie is still under active development, might have a few bugs. Use at your own risk.

Once the feature set and overall structure of Charlie is solidified I'll be doing an organization, format, etc. overhaul to make the entire project more "developer friendly" :)
